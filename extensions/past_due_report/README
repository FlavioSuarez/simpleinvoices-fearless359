This extension provides a report that shows customers with invoices
that are 30-days or more past due and optionally, the past due
invoices. 

This extension can be used in concert with the "invoice_export"
extension to make the calculated value, "past_due_amt," available
for use in the invoice that is being exported to printer, pdf,
excel spreedsheet or word document.
