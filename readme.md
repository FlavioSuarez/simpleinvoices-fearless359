## Cloning
*Note: Cloning is not necessary unless you wish to contribute to the ongoing development and maintenance of SI.*
For versions prior to Fearless359 Release, SI uses **gitsubmodules** to load the Zend Framework.  
When cloning the repository use the `--recursive` option to ensure that Zend is retrieved.  
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:simpleinvoices/simpleinvoices.git`

For the Fearless359 releases, Zend Framework is incorporated in the download.

## Updating to Current Version
These instructions should work for all version updates. They protect your current install so that you can easily revert to it if a problem is encountered. Make sure that no one is accessing your SimpleInvoices application except you.

1. In SI, select the **Backup Database** option. This will save your database content in the **dataabase_backups** directory.
1. Log out of SI. 
1. Rename the current SI directory to add "_old" to the name. *Ex*: Rename **simpleinvoices** to be **simpleinvoices_old**.
1. [Download the zip file from fearless359 on github](https://github.com/fearless359/simpleinvoices)
1. Unzip the downloaded file into your document root directory. *Ex*: On **xampp** this would be the **htdocs** directory.
1. Rename the directory created for the unzipped data, to be what you were using. *Ex*: Say you had **simpleinvoices** and renamed it to **simpleinvoices_old** per previous step. So rename the unzipped directory **simpleinvoices-master** to be **simpleinvoices**.
1. Copy the new **config/config.php** file to be **config/custom.config.php**. Then update the database, email, etc. settings in the new **config/custom.config.php** file from the settings in your old **config/config.php** or **.ini** file. SI will see the **custom.config.php** file and use it rather than the **config.php** file. This is done so that future SI updates will not write over your settings.
1. Now access SI from your browser just as you did the previous version. It should automatically bring your database current and leave your user settings and passwords the same.
