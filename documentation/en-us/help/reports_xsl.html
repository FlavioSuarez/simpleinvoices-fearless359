<b>Report errors</b><br>
<p>
If you received a "OOPS, THERE'S AN ERROR HERE." error when you attempted to run a report in SimpleInvoices this means that your version of PHP does not have the correct extensions installed(or enabled).<br><br>If your running a Windows server and using WampServer please refer to the page on the SimpleInvoices wiki for information on how to fix this https://simpleinvoices.group/howto<br><br>
If your running Unix/Linux and PHP5 please make sure you have the xsl extension installed and enabled in your php.ini. On Ubuntu GNU/Linux please install the php-xsl package for PHP5 <br><br>
If your using PHP4 please make sure that your PHP has Sablotron support "--enable-xslt"
<br>
<br>
Note: If you are using SimpleInvoices in the demo environment on SourceForge reports wont work due to setup of their servers</p>
